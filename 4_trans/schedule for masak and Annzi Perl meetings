== Meeting 1: sed, awk, and perl -- historical context

* sed: the world is lines
* awk: thinking in patterns
* perl: scan, extract, and report
* -n and -p
* BEGIN and END
* next, last, redo
* perldoc (perlintro, perlsyn, perlstyle, perlop), perldoc -f

== Meeting 2: Scalars, arrays, hashes, and subs

* Sigils: $ @ % &
* Four types to cover all your needs
* Sigil variance
* Flattening
* More -n and -p and one-liners
* if, unless, for, while, until

== Meeting 3: Scalars

* Value context: Str, Num, Int, Bool
* Math operators: + - * / % **
* String operators: . x
* String interpolation
* Assignment operators: += -+ etc, and ++ and --
* ord and chr
* reverse, length, index, and rindex
* substr
* sprintf and printf
* <>
* chop and chomp
* =~, !~, m//, s///, and tr///
* (why vim rocks)
* The parenthesis trap

== Meeting 4: Arrays

* Declaration and assignment
* Indexing and slicing
* Lists and arrays aren't the same thing
* qw<>
* Stacks: push and pop
* Queues: push and shift
* grep and map
* The aliasing of $_ in loops (and 'my' in for loops)
* next, last, redo and loop labels
* split and join
* sort, <=> and cmp
* Amount context: scalar context and list context (x, <> and reverse)
* List assignment

== Meeting 5: Hashes

* Declaration and assignment
* Indexing and slicing
* keys and values
* exists and delete
* Used as mappings
* Used as sparse arrays
* The 'seen' idiom
* Used as sets
* Used as dispatch tables
* Used to make lists unique
* Used for counting

== Meeting 6: Subs

* @_ and argument unpacking
* 'return' and implicit return
* exceptions: &eval and Try::Tiny
* tail-calling with &goto
* Anonymous subs
* Higher-order functions
* Closures
* Callbacks

== Meeting 7: References

* Array references
* Hash references
* Deeply nested structures
* YAML has a Dump sub, which rocks

== Meeting 8: Regexes

* Quantifiers
* Character classes
* Captures and $1, $2, $3...
* /g
* /i
* /x and readability
* /m and /s
* /e

== Meeting 9: Modules

* 'use'
* CPAN, the cradle of civilization
* Modules you should know about

== Meeting 10: Classes and objects

* Blessing hash references, just for old times' sake
* Methods are just subs in a package
* Moose
