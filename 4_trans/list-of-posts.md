This weekend for the first time in quite a while, I'm not doing anything else, so I'm planning to blog quite a bit. Here's a list of my accrued ideas:

* An interesting (fixed) vulnerability in the `SOAP::Lite` module on CPAN

* A series on the Little Animal Farm game
    1. Origins
    1. Design
    1. Event sourcing
    1. Computer players
    1. That thing about defensive copies

* Why tests will change the way you code (if they haven't already)

* How macros work

* A short post about how the `EXEC_OK` constant solves problem of reading `system` calls in code and having to think backwards

* The -n and -p flags, and how (differently) they are applied in the Perl 5 runtime and Rakudo.
