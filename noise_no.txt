Trying to avoid line noise (brain cramp)
 
 # original: /([^(]+)(\([^)]+\))(.*)/

my $not_paren = "[^(]+";
my $paren     = "\\(";
my $rest      = ".*";

# now reads:
$string =~ /($not_paren)($paren$not_paren$paren)($rest)/; 

Here's one more way to de-line-noise-ify the code:

my $leftparen = quotemeta "("; 
my $rightparen = quotemeta ")";
